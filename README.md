**MiniCloud** turns your personal computers into a **private, home-based cloud platform** — your own *mini AWS*.

Run distributed tasks, monitor metrics, and manage your fleet of machines — all locally, with zero ongoing costs.

## 🚀 Vision

MiniCloud brings **cloud-like primitives** — compute orchestration, messaging, and observability — into the hands of individual developers and hobbyists using their own personal hardware.

It’s designed for people who love to experiment, build home labs, or simply want full control over their computing environment without relying on third-party cloud providers.

## 📍 Example Use Cases

- Run distributed or background tasks across your home computers.  
- Host small applications or services on your personal hardware.  
- Experiment with distributed systems or task orchestration locally.  
- Centralize monitoring for multiple development machines.
